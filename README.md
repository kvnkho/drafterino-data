This folder will contain the code related to pulling the data from OpenDota. The data will be stored in a MongoDB instance.

There MongoDB instance will connect to a pipeline that will output analytics. The analytics will be loaded by the frontend.

As long as the pulling from OpenDota is efficient and production ready, we can iterate over the pipeline and analytics.
